The growth of younger and educated Muslims with larger disposable income has also further increase their propensity to travel abroad. This study explores the influence of perceived destination attributes on Muslim tourist satisfaction and eventual destination loyalty. The population of the study were Muslim travellers intercepted at the Penang International Airport. A purposive sampling procedure was applied and data collection was through self administered questionnaire. A structural equation modelling approach (using SmartPLS 3.0 software) was employed for data analysisand testing of the research model. The results of the analysis were critically discussed and suggestions were proposed, for practical and empirical purpose.
