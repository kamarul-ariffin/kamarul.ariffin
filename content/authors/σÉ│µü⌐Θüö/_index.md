I graduated from the [University of Kentucky](https://math.as.uky.edu/) with a BSc in Mathematics with Economics in 1992. In 2010 I started working toward my MSc in Decision Sciences as a part-time student at [Universiti Utara Malaysia](http://sqs.uum.edu.my/), under the School of Quantitative Sciences, College of Art and Sciences (CAS), where I did my partial thesis paper in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) under the advisement of [Assoc. Prof. Dr. Zahayu Md Yusof](http://experts.uum.edu.my/Researcher_Info.aspx?nopkj=1869) and [Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nazrina Aziz](http://experts.uum.edu.my/Researcher_Info.aspx?nopkj=2237). I graduated from UUM at the end of 2012.  

I have been serving Universiti Teknologi MARA Kedah Branch Campus since March 2002 and currently hold a position as a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences.  

I am also an active training instructor especially in the area of Structural Equation Modeling using software such as SmartPLS and AMOS. Other than that, I am also able to delivers training workshops in data analysis using other statistical softwares, among them are IBM SPSS Statistics, R, JASP, jamovi, StatNotes, BlueStatistics, and also Excel.  

I am an intermediate user in R and being an active member of [Malaysian R User Public Group](https://www.meetup.com/Malaysia-R-User-Group/). Recently, I begin exploring Python programming language.
